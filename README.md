This repository contains the latest version of our formal model for the AMAN case study at ABZ 2023.

* The case study can be started from an up-to-date version of [ProB 2 UI](https://www3.hhu.de/stups/downloads/prob2/snapshot/). 
    * The VO manager can be started under the "Advanced" menu.
* The folder can also be treated as a Rodin project and started from within the IDE.
* `AMAN_v7` is the current version of our formal model, while `AMAN_v6` is an earlier version
* HTML scenarios can be inspected by domain experts together with a domain-specific VisB visualization
